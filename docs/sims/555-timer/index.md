The 555 timer IC is an integrated circuit used in a variety of timer, delay, pulse generation, and oscillator applications. It is one of the most popular timing ICs due to its flexibility and price.

## Prompt

```linenums="0"
Create a single file p5.js simulation of a 555 timer in monostable mode.
Add sliders for resistance and capacitance.
Make the canvas be 400x250.
Make the text size be 16.
Draw a waveform and an LED that flashes.
Place the sliders at the bottom of the canvas in the bottom 50 pixels.
Add labels and values to the left of the sliders.  
```
